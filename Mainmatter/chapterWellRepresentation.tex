\chapter{Well Representation}
\label{wellRepresentaion}
This chapter shows how the well has been modeled in the simulator developed in this project. According to \cite{Ertekin2001}, wells are considered to be internal boundaries of the reservoir system, and therefore boundary conditions must be specified for the problem to be solved. One possible boundary condition is to utilize a specified flowing sandface pressure $p_{wf}$, characterizing a Dirichlet-type boundary condition. Another approach is by specifying a well flow rate, which characterizes a Neumann-type boundary condition. This simulator has been developed considering the well to be flow-rate specified. The well will be linked to the single-phase flow equation, Eq. \ref{rearranjo}, by the utilization of a source/sink term $q_{sc}$. This term is present in every cell of the model, but it is only non-zero if the grid block contains a producing or injecting well completion. The source/sink term $q_{sc}$ can change with time, enabling the flow rate to be changed in the simulation input. Figure \ref{fig:flowrate} shows an example of $q_{sc}$ for a flow-rate specified well. The values of $q_{sc}$ are negative in this graphic since the well is set to be producing and negative values stands for production while positive ones represent injection.

Considering a steady-state flow near the wellbore, the radial form of the Darcy's law is:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm2}
q=\frac{-2\pi \beta_c k h r_w}{\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}\Bigg|_{r=r_w},
\end{equation}
in which $r_w$ is the well radius. Rearranging and considering a flow rate fixed in a specific value:
\nomenclature[R]{$r_w$}{Well radius}
\nomenclature[R]{$r$}{Radial dimension for cilindrical coordinates}
\nomenclature[R]{$h$}{Reservoir height}
\nomenclature[R]{$c$}{Generic constant}
\begin{equation}
\label{wm3}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}\Bigg|_{r=r_w}=-\frac{\mu}{2\pi\beta_c khr_w}q_{sp}.
\end{equation}
Since $\mu$, $\beta_c$, $k$, $h$ and $r_w$ are specific for the problem, the pressure gradient should be constant:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm1}
\frac{\partial p}{\partial r}=c,
\end{equation}
in which $c$ represents a generic constant. Thus, it characterizes a Neumann-type boundary condition. To determine the well performance in a given perforated cell, it is necessary to know the grid block pressure, $p_{i,j,k}$, the flowing sandface pressure, $p_{wf}$, and the production rate, $q_{sc}$. Therefore, it is necessary to develop equations to relate the grid block unknowns to the unknowns added by the well model.
\section{Inflow Performance Relationship}
For a steady-state flow in the vicinity of the wellbore, the radial form of the Darcy's law is:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm4}
q=-\frac{2\pi\beta_c k_H h r}{\mu} \frac{\partial p}{\partial r},
\end{equation}
in which $k_H$ is the radial permeability, equals to the geometrical mean of $k_x$ and $k_y$. Rearranging and integrating it:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm5}
\int_{r_w}^{r}\frac{1}{r}\partial r = -\frac{2\pi\beta_c k_H h}{q \mu}\int_{p_{wf}}^{p}\partial p.
\end{equation}
Thus:
\nomenclature[R]{$p_{wf}$}{Bottom hole flowing pressure}
\nomenclature[R]{$k_H$}{Radial permeability}
\begin{equation}
\label{wm6}
p=p_{wf}-\frac{q \mu}{2 \pi \beta_c k_H h}\ln\left(\frac{r}{r_w}\right).
\end{equation}
In terms of flow rate:
\nomenclature[R]{$p_e$}{Reservoir external pressure}
\nomenclature[R]{$r_e$}{Reservoir external radius}
\begin{equation}
\label{wm7}
q=-\frac{2\pi\beta_c k_H h}{\mu \log_e(r_e/r_w)} (p_e - p_{wf}),
\end{equation}
in which $p_e$ is the reservoir external pressure, and $r_e$ is the reservoir external radius. Considering the flow rate in the surface conditions:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm8}
q_{sc}=-\frac{2\pi\beta_c k_H h}{\mu B \ln(r_e/r_w)} (p_e - p_{wf}),
\end{equation}
This is the inflow performance relationship (IPR) for a undamaged well under a steady-state flow. However, in reservoir engineering the IPR is usually express in terms of the average reservoir pressure, instead of the external boundary pressure. According to \cite{Ertekin2001}, for a cylindrical reservoir, its average pressure, $\bar{p}$, could be described as:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm9}
\bar{p}=\left[ \int_{r_w}^{r_e} 2 \pi r h p dr \right]/\left[ \int_{r_w}^{r_e} 2 \pi r h dr \right].
\end{equation}
Substituting Eq. \ref{wm6} in Eq. \ref{wm9}:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm10}
\bar{p}=\frac{2}{(r_e^2-r_w^2)} \int_{r_w}^{r_e} p r dr.
\end{equation}
Developing the equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm11}
\bar{p}=\frac{2}{(r_e^2-r_w^2)} \int_{r_w}^{r_e} \left[ p_{wf} - \frac{q \mu}{2 \pi \beta_c k_H h} \log_e \left(\frac{r_e}{r_w}\right) \right] r dr.
\end{equation}
Solving the integral in the right term:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm12}
\bar{p}= p_{wf} - \frac{q \mu}{2 \pi \beta_c k_H h (r_e^2-r_w^2)} \left[ r_e^2 \log_e \left(\frac{r_e}{r_w}\right) (r_e^2-r_w^2) \right].
\end{equation}
When $r_e >> r_w$, the term $(r_e^2-r_w^2)$ tends to $r_e^2$. Rearranging:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm13}
\bar{p}=p_{wf} - \frac{q \mu}{2 \pi \beta_c k_H h}\left[ \log_e \left(\frac{r_e}{r_w}\right)\right]
\end{equation}
In terms of  flow rate:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm14}
q = \frac{- 2 \pi \beta_c k_H h}{\mu \left[ \log_e \left(\frac{r_e}{r_w}\right)\right]} (\bar{p}-p_{wf}),
\end{equation}
In standard conditions:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm15}
q_{sc} = \frac{- 2 \pi \beta_c k_H h}{\mu B \left[ \log_e \left(\frac{r_e}{r_w}\right)\right]} (\bar{p}-p_{wf}),
\end{equation}
The skin factor $s$ is a dimensionless pressure drop utilized for representing a damage (if positive) or a stimulation (if negative) in the wellbore. Including it in the equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm16}
q_{sc} = \frac{- 2 \pi \beta_c k_H h}{\mu B \left[ \log_e \left(\frac{r_e}{r_w}\right) + s\right]} (\bar{p}-p_{wf}),
\end{equation}
This is the final form of the IPR equation for a well considering a steady-state flow in its boundaries. Utilizing the definition of the well's productivity index (PI), $J_w$:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm18}
J_w = \frac{ 2 \pi \beta_c k_H h}{\mu B\left[ \log_e \left(\frac{r_e}{r_w}\right) + s\right]},
\end{equation}
\nomenclature[R]{$J_w$}{Productivity index for the well}
\nomenclature[A]{PI}{Productivity Index}
\nomenclature[A]{IPR}{Inflow Performance Relationship}
thus, the IPR equation could be simplified as:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm17}
q_{sc} = - J_w \left( \bar{p}-p_{wf} \right),
\end{equation}
The next subchapter shows a model for calculating $r_e$ as the equivalent well radius $r_{eq}$. Assembling that definition into Eq. \ref{wm18} will make it possible to calculate $q_{sc}$ and utilize it as the sources/sinks terms in the single-phase flow equation, \ref{rearranjo}. However, this is only possible in rate-specified wells passing across a single perforated grid block. In wells with multiple perforated layers, it is necessary to decompose the total specified well flow rate into individual flow rates of each perforated grid block. This process will be shown in the last part of this chapter.

\section{Peaceman Model}
The simulator has been developed for considering a vertical well passing across the center of the grid blocks. The well grid block is not necessarily square and the simulator considers an anisotropic reservoir in terms of petrophysical proprieties. Then, the $r_e$ in the Eq. \ref{wm18} will be approximated by the equivalent well radius $r_{eq}$ in the Peaceman model for non-square grid blocks with anysotropic permeability.
\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption{Vertical section of the wellbore and the grid blocks considered in its flow model. Source: \cite{Ertekin2001}.}
	\label{fig:23}
\end{figure}
According to \cite{Ertekin2001}, the equivalent well radius, $r_{eq}$, in which the steady-state reservoir pressure is equal to the pressure in the well grid block, $p_{i,j,k}$, is:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm19}
r_{eq} = 0.28 \frac{ \left\lbrace \left[ (k_y/k_x)^{\sfrac{1}{2}} (\Delta x)^2 \right] + \left[ (k_x/k_y)^{\sfrac{1}{2}} (\Delta y)^2 \right]\right\rbrace^{\sfrac{1}{2}}}{ (k_y/k_x)^{\sfrac{1}{4}} + (k_x/k_y)^{\sfrac{1}{4}}}
\end{equation}
This is the Peaceman model for non-square grid blocks with anisotropic permeability. This definition of $r_{eq}$ can then be assembled into Eq. \ref{wm18}, making possible the calculation of the well productivity index, $J_w$.

\section{Well Model for Multiple Perforated Layers}
The Eqs. \ref{wm6} and \ref{wm19} alone can only represent a well with producing/injecting intervals inside a single grid block. For wells with more than one cell containing open completions, a different approach is required. Figure \ref{fig:22} illustrates a well passing across multiple layers. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Images/22}
	\caption{Wellbore with multiple layers. Source: \cite{Ertekin2001}.}
	\label{fig:22}
\end{figure}
Each perforated cell can and probably have different proprieties such as permeabilities, $k_{H_k}$, skin factor, $s_k$, radii, $r_{w_k}$, and, consequently, productivity indexes, $J_{w_k}$. Furthermore, each perforated layer can have different flowing sandface pressures, $p_{{wf}_k}$, and grid blocks pressures, ${p_k}$. In reservoir engineering, flow-rate specified wells usually are described by their total flow rate in surface conditions, $q_{spsc}$. That, however, is not the flow rate value utilized in the source/sink terms $q_{sc}$ in the Eq. \ref{rearranjo}. $q_{spsc}$ represents the flow rate of the entire well, while $q_{sc}$ is only the individual flow rate of a given grid block region. Decomposing this total flow rate, $q_{spsc}$, in the individual flow rates of each layer, $q_{{sc}_k}$, can not be done by just dividing it equally for each perforated grid block. Since each of the cells has different $p_{i,j,k}$, $p_{wf}$ and $J_{w}$, the $q_{{sc}_k}$ are not necessarily equal fractions of $q_{spsc}$. Figures \ref{fig:multilayering} and \ref{fig:multilayering2} help to visualize this idea. The first image shows an unrealistic well model in which each grid block in the wellbore region has exactly the same source/sink term, while the second image shows a realistic model, in which the total flow rate $q_{spsc}$ is decomposed in different individual flow rates $q_{{sc}_k}$ for each grid block. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Images/multilayering}
	\caption{Example of well completions passing across multiple grid blocks. The color represents the source/sink term of each grid block in a given time step for a production scenario. This image represents an unrealistic scenario since each layer has the exact same value of individual flow rate.}
	\label{fig:multilayering}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Images/multilayering2}
	\caption{Example of well completions passing across multiple grid blocks. The color represents the source/sink term of each grid block in a given time step for a production scenario. This image represents a realistic scenario in which each layer has a different value of individual flow rate.}
	\label{fig:multilayering2}
\end{figure}
The well model developed in this project approaches the multilayering by a method proposed by \cite{Ertekin2001}. In a final analysis, the objective is to calculate the individual flow rates $q{sc_k}$ for all the cells in the well perforations domain, then it would be possible to input them as the source/sink terms in the single-phase flow equation, \ref{rearranjo}. This needs to be done for each time step, since $q{sc_k}$ depends on some proprieties that can change with time (e.g. $\mu$, $B$, $\gamma_{wb}$, $\bar{p}$ and $q_{spsc}$). This process will result in an iteration, since the specific weight inside the wellbore $\gamma_{wb}$ and the flowing sandface pressure $p_{wf}$ are unknowns and mutually dependent. This process will be described below.

The IPR equation, Eq. \ref{wm16}, for a given perforated grid block in a layer $k$, is:
\nomenclature[R]{$s$}{Skin factor}
\nomenclature[R]{$r_{eq}$}{Equivalent radius}
\begin{equation}
\label{wm20}
q_{{sc}_k} = \frac{- 2 \pi \beta_c k_{H k} h_k}{\mu_k B_k \left[ \log_e \left(\frac{r_{eq_k}}{r_w}\right) + s_k\right]} (\bar{p_k}-p_{{wf}_k}),
\end{equation}
which could be rewritten in terms of the PI as:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm21}
q_{{sc}_k} = - J_{w_k} \left( p_k - p_{wf_k} \right),
\end{equation}
in which:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm22}
J_{w_k} = \frac{ 2 \pi \beta_c k_{H_k} h_k}{\mu_k B_k\left[ \log_e \left(\frac{r_{eq_k}}{r_w}\right) + s_k\right]}.
\end{equation}
The total flow rate of the well, $q_{spsc}$, is the sum of all the individual flow rates of the perforated layers, $q_{{sc}_k}$. Thus:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm23}
q_{spsc} = - \sum_{k} J_{w_k} (p_k- p_{wf_k}),
\end{equation}
in which $k \in \psi_w$, where $\psi_w$ is the set of all the perforated grid blocks. Similarly to the variables in the flow equation, it is necessary to determine a time level in which the well flow rates will be evaluated. It has been utilized the simple iteration method, where the IPR parameters are evaluated at the time level $n+1$, but at the previous iteration level, $\nu$.

For determining the pressure distribution inside the wellbore, the common approach in reservoir simulation is to neglect the friction losses inside the tubing and downhole equipment. Although this is not the most realistic approach, integrating those effects in a reservoir simulator would result in a system with high complexity, requiring an unfeasible amount of computational power. There are in the industry simulators specially made for analyzing the flow inside the well and pipeline systems, but those are not commonly integrated to reservoir simulators. After neglecting the friction losses inside the wellbore, the flowing sandface pressures for each individual layers, $p_{wf_k}$, can be obtained by:
\nomenclature[U]{$ref$}{Reference}
\nomenclature[U]{$k$}{Layer index}
\nomenclature[G]{$\gamma_{wb}$}{Average specific weight inside the wellbore}
\nomenclature[R]{$q_{spsc}$}{Total specified flow rate for the well in the standard conditions}
\begin{equation}
\label{wm24}
p_{wf_k} = p_{wf_{ref}} + \int_{H_{ref}}^{H_k} \gamma_{wb} dH,
\end{equation}
where $p_{wf_{ref}}$ is the flowing sandface pressure of a reference layer, and $\gamma_{wb}$ is the specific weight inside the wellbore in the perforated grid blocks. For the simulator developed in this project, the selected reference layer has been the topmost perforated cell. \cite{Ertekin2001} recommends the following approximation to this integral:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm25}
p_{wf_k} = p_{wf_{ref}} + \bar{\gamma}_{wb} (H_k - H_{ref}).
\end{equation}
in which $H_{ref}$ is the depth of the reference layer, $H_k$ is the depth of a given layer $k$ and $\gamma_{wb}$ is the average specific weight in the well for the perforated region. The average flowing sandface pressure, $\bar{p}_{wf}$, could be described as the arithmetic average between the lowest and the highest pressures inside the perforated regions of the wellbore, those are $p_{{wf}_{ref}}$ and $p_{{wf}_n}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm26}
\bar{p}_{wf} = \frac{p_{wf_{ref}} + p_{wf_{n}}}{2},
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the index of the lowermost perforated cell. For allocating the quotes of the total well flow rate in each perforated layer, the following relationship is valid:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm32}
q_{sc_k} = \frac{q_{sc_k}}{q_{spsc}}q_{spsc},
\end{equation}
Applying the IPR equation, Eq \ref{wm21}:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm27}
q_{sc_k} = \frac{J_{w_k} (p_k- p_{wf_k})}{\sum_{m}J_{w_m} (p_m- p_{wf_m})} q_{spsc},
\end{equation}
where $m$ and $k \in \psi_w$. \cite{Ertekin2001} describes it as the potential method for multilayering. Substituting the Eq. \ref{wm25} in the IPR equation for the total flow rate in the well, Eq. \ref{wm21}:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm30}
q_{spsc} = \sum_{k} J_{w_k} \left\lbrace p_k - \left[ p_{wf_{ref}} + \bar{\gamma}_{wb} \left( H_k - H_{ref} \right)  \right]  \right\rbrace,
\end{equation}
Rearranging:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm31}
q_{spsc} = \sum_{k} J_{w_k} \left[  p_k - \bar{\gamma}_{wb} \left( H_k - H_{ref} \right) \right] + \sum_{k} J_{w_k} p_{wf_{ref}},
\end{equation}
After further rearrangements, in terms of $p_{wf_{ref}}$:
\begin{equation}
\label{wm28}
p_{wf_{ref}} = \frac{\sum_{k} \left\lbrace J_{w_k} \left[ p_k - \bar{\gamma}_{wb} (H_k - H_{ref})\right] \right\rbrace + q_{spsc}}{\sum_{k}J_{w_k}},
\end{equation}
Since both $\bar{\gamma}_{wb}$ and $p_{wf_{k}}$ are unknowns and mutually dependent, it is necessary to perform an iterative process. The Table \ref{tbl:4} shows the iterative approach that has been utilized:

\begin{table}[htbp]
	\centering
	\caption{Iterative process for modeling a well with multiple perforated grid blocks.}
	\begin{tabular}{r l}

		$8)$ & $\bar{\gamma}_{wb}^{new}$ is interpolated for the new value of $\bar{p}_{wf}$.\\
		$9)$ & If $|\bar{\gamma}_{wb}^{new} - \bar{\gamma}_{wb}| > \epsilon$, $\bar{\gamma}_{wb} = \bar{\gamma}_{wb}^{new}$ and return to $4)$. Otherwise, go to $10)$.\\
		$10)$ & Finally, $q_{{sc}_k}$ is calculated with Eq. \ref{wm27} for each perforated cell.\\
		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
	\label{tbl:4}
\end{table}
After performing this process, the individual well flow rates $q_{sc_k}$ are finally obtained. Then it is possible to utilize those values in the single-phase flow equation \ref{rearranjo}. Note that this process has to be done for each time step in the simulation, since that, as shown above, $q_{sc_k}$ depends on proprieties that change with time.
